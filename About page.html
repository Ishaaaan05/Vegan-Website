                            This website is our initiative to make vegan recipes accessible to everyone. Veganism isn't just a lifestyle but it is also a contribution towards the mother nature. 
                            By following Veganism, we as individuals think about the plant based and different substitutes to our daily foods, which are not only healthy but also wholesome. 
                            The website shows a variety of recipes of vegan dishes and lists their ingredients, which obviously one can choose according to their liking.
